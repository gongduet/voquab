TASK: Add Paragraph Spacing to Reading Mode
Add visual paragraph breaks in Reading Mode based on is_paragraph_start flag.

1. Update Data Fetching
Ensure is_paragraph_start is included when fetching sentences.
In useReadingProgress.js, check that sentence queries include this field:
javascript.select(`
  *,
  sentence_fragments(*),
  is_paragraph_start
`)

2. Add Spacing in ReadingPage.jsx
Where completed sentences are rendered, add a gap before paragraph starts:
jsx{completedSentences.map((sentence, index) => (
  <React.Fragment key={sentence.sentence_id}>
    {/* Paragraph spacing - but not before first sentence */}
    {sentence.is_paragraph_start && index > 0 && (
      <div className="h-6 md:h-8" /> 
    )}
    <CompletedSentence sentence={sentence} ... />
  </React.Fragment>
))}

3. Also Check Active Sentence
If the current active sentence is a paragraph start (and there are completed sentences above), add spacing above it:
jsx{/* Active sentence with potential paragraph spacing */}
{currentSentence && (
  <>
    {currentSentence.is_paragraph_start && completedSentences.length > 0 && (
      <div className="h-6 md:h-8" />
    )}
    <ActiveSentence ... />
  </>
)}

4. Chapter Title Already Creates Break
The ChapterTitle component already creates visual separation, so sentences marked as paragraph start that are also the first sentence of a chapter don't need extra spacing (they follow the chapter title).
Add a check to avoid double-spacing:
jsx{sentence.is_paragraph_start && index > 0 && !isFirstSentenceOfChapter(sentence) && (
  <div className="h-6 md:h-8" />
)}
Or simpler - just check index > 0 should be sufficient since the first sentence of each chapter naturally follows the chapter title.

Testing

 Paragraph spacing appears where is_paragraph_start = true
 No spacing before first sentence of chapter (already has chapter title)
 Spacing appears for active sentence if it's a paragraph start
 Spacing is visible but not excessive (h-6 = 24px, h-8 = 32px)
