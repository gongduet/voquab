TASK: Audit Fragment Generation Progress
The fragment generation script encountered errors partway through processing chapters 4-27. I need a complete audit of the current state.
Run these diagnostic queries and report the results:
1. Fragment Coverage by Chapter
For each chapter (1-27), show:

Chapter number
Total sentences in chapter
Sentences WITH fragments
Sentences WITHOUT fragments
Total fragments created
Coverage percentage

Format as a table sorted by chapter number.
2. Identify Missing Sentences
List all sentences that do NOT have any entries in sentence_fragments:

Chapter number
Sentence order
First 50 characters of sentence_text
Whether it has a translation (yes/no)

Group by chapter so we can see where the gaps are.
3. Check for Duplicates
Check if any sentence has duplicate fragment entries:
sqlSELECT sentence_id, fragment_order, COUNT(*) 
FROM sentence_fragments 
GROUP BY sentence_id, fragment_order 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

Report any duplicates found.

### 4. Last Successfully Processed

Identify the last sentence that was successfully processed:
- Find the highest chapter number that has ANY fragments
- Within that chapter, find the highest sentence_order with fragments
- Show that sentence's details

### 5. Error Pattern Analysis

Check if there's a pattern to missing sentences:
- Are they clustered in specific chapters?
- Are they sentences without translations?
- Are they unusually long sentences?

### 6. Summary Report

Provide a clear summary:
```

Once we see this audit, we'll know exactly what needs to be fixed and how to complete the remaining work.
