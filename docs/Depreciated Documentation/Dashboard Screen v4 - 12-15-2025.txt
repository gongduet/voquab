Claude Code Prompt: Remove Redundant "TODAY" Label (v30)
Task: Remove the "TODAY" label that appears above the first bar in the Upcoming Reviews chart, since "Today" already appears below as the day label.

Update src/components/dashboard/ReviewForecast.jsx
Find and delete this block (around lines 60-65):
jsx{/* Today label - positioned at top */}
{isToday && (
  <span className="text-[9px] font-bold text-primary-500 mb-auto">
    TODAY
  </span>
)}

That's it - just remove those 5 lines. The "Today" label below the bar is sufficient.
