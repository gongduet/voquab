Claude Code Prompt: Netlify SPA Routing Fix (v32)
Task: Add Netlify redirect configuration so all routes serve index.html, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

Create public/_redirects
Create a new file at public/_redirects with this single line:
/*    /index.html   200
That's it! This tells Netlify: "For any URL path, serve index.html with a 200 status code."

Alternative: If netlify.toml exists in project root
If there's already a netlify.toml file, add this section instead:
toml[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

Why This Works
BeforeAfterNetlify looks for /flashcards file → 404Netlify serves index.html → React Router handles /flashcardsDirect URL access brokenDirect URL access worksRefresh on any page → 404Refresh on any page → works
Expected Result
After deploying, users can:

Refresh any page without getting 404
Share direct links to any route
Return to the app after phone idle without errors
