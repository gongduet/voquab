TASK: Complete Fragment Generation for Missing Sentences
Re-run the fragment generation script for chapters with missing sentences. The script already skips sentences that have fragments, so this will only process the 94 missing sentences.
bashnode scripts/content_pipeline/generate_fragments.js --chapters 5 6 8 10 11 14 15 21 22 26 27
After completion, run a verification query:
sqlSELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_sentences,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sf.sentence_id IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_fragments,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN sf.sentence_id IS NULL THEN 1 END) as without_fragments
FROM sentences s
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT DISTINCT sentence_id FROM sentence_fragments
) sf ON s.sentence_id = sf.sentence_id;
Report:

The processing results (sentences processed, fragments created, any errors)
The verification query results
If any sentences are still missing, list them by chapter and sentence order

Goal: 815/815 sentences with fragments (100% coverage)

Let me know the final results.
