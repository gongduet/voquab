TASK: Document Current App Architecture for Reading Mode Planning
I'm planning to build a new Reading Mode feature and need to understand the existing codebase structure. Please provide a comprehensive overview:
1. Route/Navigation Structure

List all current routes in the app (from router config)
How is navigation structured (tabs, sidebar, bottom nav)?
Where does the chapter carousel/selection currently live?
What's the current URL pattern for chapter-related pages?

2. Key Component Examples
For each of these, show the JSX structure and list the hooks used (don't need full implementation):
a) Flashcard display component

How are the difficulty buttons structured?
How does card content render?
Any animations?

b) Chapter carousel/selection

How are chapters displayed?
How does unlock state show?
Navigation to chapter content?

c) Any page that has a "session" concept

How does session state work?
How is progress tracked during a session?

3. Styling & Animation

What styling approach? (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc.)
Is there a design system or theme file?
What animation library (if any)? framer-motion? CSS transitions?
Any existing fade-in or transition patterns I should follow?

4. Data Patterns

How are Supabase queries structured? (hooks, services, direct calls?)
How is user progress fetched and updated?
Any shared contexts or global state?
Pattern for optimistic updates?

5. Relevant Hooks
List hooks related to:

User progress tracking
Session management
Content data fetching
Any scroll or position tracking

6. File Structure
Provide a tree view of src/ directory (3 levels deep), highlighting:

Where page components live
Where shared components live
Where hooks live
Where services/utilities live

7. Mobile Considerations

Is there a breakpoint system?
Any mobile-specific components or patterns?
How do existing features handle touch vs mouse?

Format this as a structured document that gives a complete picture of how to build a new feature that fits the existing patterns.

Once you share that architecture overview, I'll have everything needed to write a comprehensive, pattern-consistent implementation prompt for Reading Mode.
