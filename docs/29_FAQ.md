## GENERAL QUESTIONS

### What is Voquab?

Voquab is a Spanish vocabulary learning app that teaches through "El Principito" (The Little Prince). Every word is learned in context through actual sentences from the story.

**Different from other apps:**
- Real literature, not artificial examples
- Context-based learning (see words in sentences)
- Beautiful reading experience
- Honest progress tracking (no dark patterns)
- Built by a learner, for learners

---

### Who is Voquab for?

**Perfect for:**
- Spanish learners (A2-B1 level, intermediate beginner)
- Literature lovers who want to read classics
- People frustrated with shallow vocabulary apps
- Learners who value context over rote memorization
- Anyone who loves "The Little Prince"

**Not ideal for:**
- Complete beginners (A1)
- Advanced speakers (C1-C2) - though more books coming
- People who prefer conversation-focused learning
- Those wanting rapid-fire gamification

---

### Why "The Little Prince"?

**It's the perfect learning text:**
- Beloved worldwide (140M+ copies sold)
- Simple yet profound language
- Perfect length (not too short, not too long)
- Emotionally resonant (makes learning memorable)
- Public domain (published 1943)
- Rich vocabulary (1,500+ unique words)
- A2-B1 level (intermediate beginner sweet spot)

---

### Is Voquab free?

**MVP (initial launch):** Yes, completely free

**Future (Year 2+):** Freemium model
- Core learning: Free forever
- Premium features: Subscription ($5-10/month)
  - Additional books
  - Audio pronunciation
  - Advanced analytics
  - Priority support

**Promise:** You'll never have to pay to learn vocabulary. Premium is extra content, not better learning.

---

### How is Voquab different from Duolingo?

**Voquab:**
- Real literature (The Little Prince)
- Context-based (every word in a sentence)
- Depth over speed (true mastery)
- No dark patterns (no hearts/lives)
- Reading-focused
- Quality over quantity

**Duolingo:**
- Artificial sentences ("The duck drinks milk")
- Gamification-heavy
- Conversation-focused
- Lives system (limit practice)
- Broader language coverage
- More languages available

**Both can work together!** Use Duolingo for conversation practice, Voquab for reading vocabulary.

---

### What level of Spanish do I need?

**Recommended:** A2-B1 (intermediate beginner)

**You should know:**
- Basic grammar (present, past tense)
- ~300-500 common words
- How to read simple sentences

**Too easy if:**
- You can read "El Principito" comfortably without help

**Too hard if:**
- You're a complete beginner (can't read simple Spanish)

**Don't worry if you're not sure:** The app adapts to you! Start slow, build up.

---

### Can I use Voquab on mobile?

**Yes!** Voquab is mobile-first web app.

**Works on:**
- iPhone/iPad (Safari)
- Android phones/tablets (Chrome)
- Desktop (any modern browser)

**Native app:**
- Not yet, but web app works great on mobile
- Add to home screen for app-like experience
- Native app: Maybe Year 2+

---

## LEARNING METHODOLOGY

### How does Voquab teach vocabulary?

**Our approach:**
1. **Context first:** See word in actual sentence from book
2. **Spaced repetition:** Review at optimal intervals
3. **Dual tracking:** Measure both mastery (quality) and exposure (quantity)
4. **Health system:** Words "decay" if not reviewed, creating urgency
5. **Time-gated mastery:** Can't game the system with rapid-fire reviewing

**You learn by:**
- Reading chapters
- Studying flashcards (word + sentence + translation)
- Marking difficulty (Don't Know, Hard, Medium, Easy)
- Repeating over time (spaced repetition)

---

### What are mastery levels?

**10 levels (0-100 scale):**
- **Level 0 (0-9):** New - never seen correctly
- **Level 1 (10-19):** Introduced - just met
- **Level 2 (20-29):** Recognizing - starting to recall
- **Level 3 (30-39):** Learning - needs practice
- **Level 4 (40-49):** Familiar - getting comfortable
- **Level 5 (50-59):** Known - solidly known
- **Level 6 (60-69):** Strong - strong retention
- **Level 7 (70-79):** Mastered - automatic recall
- **Level 8 (80-89):** Expert - effortless
- **Level 9 (90-94):** Native - near-native fluency
- **Level 10 (95-100):** Perfect - permanent mastery

**Progression:** Slow and steady. Each level requires time between correct reviews (time gates).

---

### What is word health?

**Health = urgency to review (0-100)**

**Concept:** Words are like plants that need watering
- Fresh words: 100 health (green)
- Neglected words: Health decays over time
- Critical words: <20 health (red) - need urgent attention!

**Decay rate:** Based on mastery level
- Low mastery: Decays fast (25 points/day)
- High mastery: Decays slow (0.5 points/day)

**Restoration:** Review the word → health restored
- Don't Know: +10 health
- Hard: +30 health
- Medium: +60 health
- Easy: +100 health (full)

**Why it matters:** Creates natural review schedule, prioritizes struggling words

---

### What are time gates?

**Rule:** You can't gain mastery points too quickly

**Example:** 
- Word at Level 3 (Learning)
- Time gate: 24 hours
- You review word correctly → gain +6 mastery
- Try again 2 hours later → mastery blocked (time gate not met)
- Health still improves! But mastery waits.

**Why:** Prevents cramming. True learning requires spaced repetition.

**Gates by level:**
- Level 0-1: No gate / 4 hours
- Level 2-4: 12 hours / 1 day / 3 days
- Level 5-7: 7 days / 14 days / 30 days
- Level 8-10: 60 days / 120 days / 180 days

---

### How do chapters unlock?

**Sequential unlocking:** Chapter 2 requires Chapter 1 complete, etc.

**Requirements (need ALL):**
1. **Encounter 80%** of chapter's words
2. **PLUS one of these paths:**
   - **Path A (Quality):** 40 average mastery
   - **Path B (Quantity):** 50 total reviews
   - **Path C (Balanced):** 30 mastery AND 30 reviews

**Why dual paths:** Rewards both fast learners (quality) and persistent learners (quantity)

**Track progress:** See unlock % on Book page

---

### Can I study words from later chapters?

**Not yet.** Chapters are locked to prevent overwhelm and ensure progression.

**Future feature (post-MVP):** Unlock all chapters option for advanced users

---

### How many words should I study per day?

**It depends on you!**

**Recommended:**
- **Busy days:** 25-50 words (10-15 minutes)
- **Normal days:** 50-100 words (20-30 minutes)
- **Intensive:** 150+ words (45-60 minutes)

**MVP:** Simple session sizes (15, 20, 25 cards)

**Post-MVP:** Daily packages (50/100/150/250 word commitments)

**Our advice:** Consistency > volume. Better to do 25 words daily than 200 words once a week.

---

### What if I forget a word?

**Mark "Don't Know"** - it's okay!

**What happens:**
- Word reappears later in same session (3-7 cards later)
- Mastery decreases (-5 points)
- Health gets small boost (+10)
- Word prioritized for future sessions

**Don't worry:** Forgetting is part of learning. The system adapts.

---

### How long to complete the book?

**Depends on:**
- Your current level
- Study frequency
- Session size

**Estimates:**
- **Intensive (150 words/day, 5x/week):** 2-3 months
- **Standard (100 words/day, 4x/week):** 4-6 months
- **Relaxed (50 words/day, 3x/week):** 8-12 months

**No rush!** Focus on mastery, not speed.

---

## TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

### What technology does Voquab use?

**Frontend:**
- React 19 (UI framework)
- Vite (build tool)
- TailwindCSS (styling)

**Backend:**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database + auth)
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data protection

**Hosting:**
- Netlify (frontend)
- Supabase (database, managed)

**APIs:**
- DeepL API (translations - 99%+ accuracy)
- spaCy (Spanish lemmatization)

**See:** `08_ARCHITECTURE.md` for details

---

### Is Voquab open source?

**Not yet, but maybe!**

**Current:** Proprietary (private code)

**Future (under consideration):**
- Open-source learning algorithm
- Open-source UI components
- Closed-source content pipeline

**Why not fully open source:**
- Content licensing complexities
- Want to validate business model first
- May open-source parts later

---

### How does the algorithm work?

**Priority scoring:** Every word gets a score (0-200+) that determines review order

**Factors:**
- **Health urgency (35%):** Lower health = higher priority
- **Frequency in book (30%):** Common words prioritized
- **Chapter position (15%):** Earlier chapters prioritized
- **Mastery readiness (10%):** Words ready to level up
- **Chapter focus (10%):** Current chapter boost

**Multipliers:**
- Critical health (<20): ×1.5
- Struggling word: ×1.3
- New word: ×0.8

**Result:** You see the most important words first

**See:** `04_LEARNING_ALGORITHM.md` for formulas

---

### Does Voquab work offline?

**Not yet (MVP).**

**Future (post-MVP):**
- Service worker for offline reading
- Cache flashcards for offline study
- Sync when back online

---

### What browsers are supported?

**Fully supported:**
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

**Requirements:**
- Modern browser (ES2020+ JavaScript)
- JavaScript enabled
- Cookies enabled (for auth)

**Not supported:**
- Internet Explorer (never)
- Very old browsers (pre-2020)

---

### Can I export my data?

**Yes! (Post-launch)**

**You can export:**
- Your vocabulary progress (JSON/CSV)
- Your review history
- Your settings

**How:** Profile → Settings → Export Data

**Privacy:** Your data is yours. Delete anytime.

**See:** `18_SECURITY.md` for details

---

## CONTENT & TRANSLATION

### How accurate are the translations?

**Target: 99%+ accuracy**

**Our process:**
1. DeepL API translation (very high quality)
2. AI validation (Claude checks context)
3. Native speaker review (20% sample)
4. User feedback (flag errors)

**Quality checks:**
- Meaning accuracy (is it correct?)
- Context fit (does it make sense in sentence?)
- Natural phrasing (is it good Spanish?)

**If you find errors:** Please report! We fix quickly.

---

### Why lemmas instead of word forms?

**Lemma = canonical form of word**

**Example:**
- Lemma: **tener** (to have)
- Word forms: tenía, tengo, tiene, tuvo, etc.

**Why lemmas:**
- Master one concept, not 20 conjugations
- Prevents deck flooding with similar forms
- More efficient learning
- Still see all forms in context!

**You learn:**
- Lemma: tener (primary flashcard)
- But see: "tenía miedo" in sentences
- Understand: All forms link to same concept

**See:** `02_DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` for architecture

---
